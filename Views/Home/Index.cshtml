                <p>
                    Hi, I'm HASSAN IMTIAZ, and I am to graduate from the University of Sialkot in 2023
                    with a degree in Software Engineering. My interests are in Front End Engineering,
                    and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.
                    I previously worked for Dumile Impex Sports, where I developed Ecommerce Store.
                    I used front end languages. What front end languages are and which are use by me?
                    Front-end web development, or client-side development, refers to working with HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript for a website or web application that allows users to see and
                    interact with them directly
